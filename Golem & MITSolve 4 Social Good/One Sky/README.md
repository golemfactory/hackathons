### Can you describe your organization in less than 200 words? *

OneSky train communities and caregivers how to unlock the potential in our world’s most vulnerable young children. Our training is based on proven practices that have been validated by research and plenty of practical experience. At the core of our OneSky Approach to working with vulnerable children is responsive care. Caregivers (teachers, nannies, parents, grandparents) are trained to use responsive care to observe children. Taking their cue from the children’s own needs and interests, they provide activities that are interactive and appropriate for the age and stage of development.
