Kū-A-Kanaka is a Native Hawaiian social enterprise providing quality products and services that revitalize Hawaiian language and culture using ancient and modern technologies. Built on 35 years of Indigenous action research, Kū-A-Kanakaʻs leadership has been on the forefront of integrating the latest educational technology with teaching Hawaiian language and culture, since we had 100 Hawaiian high school students create a multimedia Oral History CD ROM on an ancient Hawaiian valley of the kings, using a shell we designed in C++, from 1993 to 1996.  Kū-A-Kanakaʻs leaders have also spearheaded the Hawaiian culture-based learning movement with the start of Hawaiʻiʻs first fully accredited K-12 charter school in 2000, where students are frameworked as creators rather than just consumers of modern technology.  Kū-A-Kanakaʻs primary beneficiary is EA Ecoversity, a culture-based higher education and career training program for Native Hawaiians ages 15 – 35. EA Ecoversity launched in Oct 2020 and currently has 35 learners, who do not pay tuition but reciprocate through projects like building Hawaiian language apps after being training by EA Ecoversity staff.  These mobile apps are designed to help in the normalization of Hawaiian language banned in Hawaiʻi in 1896 after the illegal overthrow of Queen Liliʻuokalani, with aid of US military forces.
