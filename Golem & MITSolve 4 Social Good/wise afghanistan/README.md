### Can you describe your organization in less than 200 words? *

WISE Afghanistan is a nonprofit organization that provides healthcare and educational resources to underserved women and children throughout Afghanistan. We have provided thousands of women with supplies, resources, training and other support since 2013. In 2018, we launched the first maternal health app in the country that is aimed to improve access to health records, reduce provider burden and improve connectivity between the clinician and patient once the patient leaves the facility.

A maternal health app that allows clinicians to have digital record access and stratify the risk of their patients. The app also provides automated appointment reminders to ensure women complete a minimum of 4 prenatal visits and sends automated educational material via voice and text, depending on the gestational period.
