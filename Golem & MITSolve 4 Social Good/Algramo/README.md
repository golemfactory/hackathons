###  Can you describe your organization in less than 200 words? *

Algramo is a platform system that allows consumers to buy any product, at the fairest price, in the most convenient location with zero waste. We are currently working with Unilever, Nestle and Colgate keep their packaging in the economy and out of the environment. We use an app, IoT connected vending machines and smart packaging to provide our refill distribution system. We create tangible impact by lowering product costs by up to 40% for low-resource families and for the environment by keeping packaging waste out of our oceans.  

We created Packaging-as-a-Wallet (PaaW) that communicates with our IoT-connected vending-machines (ICVM) to dispense FMCG products into reusable packaging. Our ICVM are mounted on electric tricycles to provide Uber Eats like home REFILL of FMCG products. Currently piloting our technology with Unilever, Nestle and Colgate. Home REFILL eliminates reverse logistics-creating huge economic and environmental savings.

Our elimination of packaging waste and reverse logistic provides major savings-currently our Unilever detergent is 30% cheaper than regular Walmart price. Cost savings and customer reach of our FMCG partners, means our solution has potential to easily lock in millions of people into our convenient low cost distribution system for life's essentials.

Our app is explained in the PPT deck that was emailed to Costanza. In order of most important: 1. Incorporate AI, machine learning and emotional recognition into our app and/or our dispenser softwares. 2. Develop a scoring model for customers that helps identify higher value customers. 3. Health agents for the platform system to detect potential errors before they happen and register errors or important issues with JIRA automatically.
