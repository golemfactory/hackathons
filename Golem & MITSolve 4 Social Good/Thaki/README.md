Thaki advances digital inclusion and bridges learning gaps by providing laptops with preloaded educational content for refugee and underserved communities in the Middle East. We leverage the circular economy to collect laptops no longer needed by corporates then repurpose them for refugee and vulnerable youth by adding multilingual interactive content available offline. To date, we have benefited over 9,000 children through over 40 organizations in schools and centers in marginalized communities in Lebanon (predominantly) and Jordan, with plans to grow further in the region.

Thaki’s model leverages the best of the private sector (content, skills, tools, hardware) and, while assisting Corporate Social Responsibility aspirations and targeting 7 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, facilitates access to educational tools and content for children at marginal cost while offering an electronic waste solution to corporations and donor partners. This creates a cycle of continuity and a model where all stakeholders benefit at different intervals in the circular economy model. 

Our work was recently recognized through several prestigious awards including MIT Solve to enhance women and girls' digital literacy skills among refugee and vulnerable communities, the General Motors (GM) Prize for Learning for Girls & Women and Good Jobs & Inclusive Entrepreneurship, and the Andan Prize for Innovation for Refugee Inclusion. In 2017, we won the TEDxAmsterdamEd Award.

Digital Toolkit for teachers – A bilingual platform with a variety of resources and learning modules that support teachers (primary users) who have a range of digital literacy levels to teach more confidently and effectively with digital tools and Thaki’s educational content. These can be applied in the classroom, in a blended format, or at a distance. These resources are meant to serve as an inspiration for integrating technology rather than as strict rules to follow, and teachers are invited to adapt resources to suit their learners’ needs.
