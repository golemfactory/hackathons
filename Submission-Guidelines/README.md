# Hackathon guidelines and judging criteria

### Guidelines

- The hackathon starts on March 16th, 2021 and will end on April 21st, 2021
- Hackers must earliest start coding on March 16th. Projects started before will disqualify the entire team.
- Projects should be submitted by 11:59pm CET on April 21st
- Judging process will happen on April 22nd and 28th - winners will be announced on  April 29th.
- Community managers will reach out to participants and winners to ask to participate in developer surveys and interviews.
- Teams can be formed prior to the hackathon, or during the hackathon. Each participant has to register in order to be considered as part of a team.
- The projects presented have to be started and developed during the hackathon - while participants can develop their ideas prior to the hackathon, projects built before the hackathon will disqualify the entire team.
- Golem will not own the projects. Projects will have open source licence and will be publicly available and accessible, by the judges and whomever might be interested, on Gitcoin.
- Final delivery will include:
- A video demo (YouTube only)
- A presentation (can be either a PDF, a Google Slides, a ppt, etc) describing the project
- A working link to a Github repository containing the code, team members, presentations, demo and documentation
- Each project to be licensed using GPLv3 or a license that's compatible with it
- If any document states something that contradicts the above guidelines, the above guidelines will be the ultimate source of truth.

### Judging criterias

- Innovation: what is the innovation that the application brings to the table?
- Added value: will the application bring actual added value to its users?
- Technical: does the code work?
- Completeness: incomplete applications will not be considered.
- In addition, each track might have its own specific track judging criteria.

### Eligibility - hackathon participants

- Participants can register as a team or as individual runners. Participants can either join other teams or work alone.
- It will be a fully-online event. Participants from everywhere are welcome to apply.
- A team must consist of a minimum of 1 person and up to 5 people.
- Participants have to be over the age of 18 years old by the day the hackathon ends.
- Employees, contractors, or officers of Golem Factory GmbH and its affiliates are not eligible for participation in the hackathon.

### What are we looking for in the submissions?

- We expect nothing more than a MVP prototype
- We’re looking for end-to-end user applications! (exception: “Golem for Good” and “Hack New Golem” categories)
- Your app:
   - Ideally should solve a problem for a user or in case of “Gaming on Golem” it should be playable
   - It should be hosted on the public web or be easily installable via package/script so your user can try it :) 
   - In case of “Golem for Good” and “Hack New Golem” it can be proof-of-concept, so a Github link with clear and working running instructions is enough
   - Should be implemented correctly and working!
